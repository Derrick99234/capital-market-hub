        <p>
          <strong>1. Deposit Instructions:</strong> The investor agrees to make
          deposits into the company&apos;s designated wallet address as provided
          by the company. Any money paid directly to an investor portfolio
          manager is regarded as void. The investor shall follow the specific
          instructions provided by the company for making deposits from external
          wallets.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>2. Deposit Amount:</strong> The investor agrees to deposit the
          agreed-upon amount as outlined in the investment agreement between the
          parties. Any changes to the deposit amount must be mutually agreed
          upon in writing by both parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>3. Deposit Confirmation:</strong> Once the deposit is made,
          the investor shall provide confirmation of the deposit transaction to
          the company within two business days. The company will acknowledge
          receipt of the deposit and confirm the transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Deposit Security:</strong> The company shall take
          reasonable measures to ensure the security and integrity of the
          deposit process. However, the investor acknowledges that external
          wallet transactions may be subject to risks beyond the company&apos;s
          control, and the company shall not be liable for any loss or damage
          resulting from such risks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>5. Deposit Verification:</strong> The company reserves the
          right to verify the source of funds used for the deposit, including
          requesting additional documentation or information from the investor
          as necessary to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know your
          customer (KYC) regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>6. Deposit Refund:</strong> In the event that the company is
          unable to verify the source of funds or if the deposit transaction is
          deemed suspicious or fraudulent, the company reserves the right to
          refund the deposit to the investor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>7. Withdrawal Requests:</strong> The investor may request
          withdrawals from their investment account by providing written notice
          to the company. The company shall process withdrawal requests promptly
          and in accordance with the terms outlined in this agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>8. Taxation:</strong> Withdrawal amounts are subject to
          applicable taxes as per the prevailing tax laws and regulations. The
          company shall not deduct the required taxes from the withdrawal amount
          before processing the payment to the investor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>9. Withdrawal Processing:</strong> Upon receiving a withdrawal
          request, the company shall process the request within 3–5 business
          days, subject to any delays caused by external factors beyond the
          company&apos;s control. The company shall notify the investor once the
          withdrawal has been processed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>10. Withdrawal Fees:</strong> The company reserves the right
          to charge reasonable withdrawal fees to cover transaction costs and
          administrative expenses. Any applicable fees are non-deductible from
          the withdrawal amount before processing the payment to the investor.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>11. Withdrawal Limits:</strong> The company may impose limits
          on the minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts that an investor can
          request. Any withdrawal amounts that exceed these limits shall be
          subject to approval by the company.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>12. Confidentiality:</strong> Both parties agree to keep all
          withdrawal-related information confidential and not disclose it to any
          third parties without the other party&apos;s consent, except as
          required by law.
